# 📊 SQL Challenge – Employee Database Analysis

This project is part of a data engineering/analysis challenge designed to demonstrate proficiency with **PostgreSQL**, **SQL schema design**, and **data querying**.  

The goal was to:
- **Design and implement a relational database** from scratch.
- **Model relationships** between employees, salaries, departments, and managers.
- **Write and execute SQL queries** to extract meaningful insights.
- Apply **best practices** for database normalization, indexing, and performance optimization.

This project replicates a realistic HR database scenario that you might encounter in a data analytics or engineering role.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **PostgreSQL** (Database engine)
- **SQL (DDL & DML)** for schema and queries
- **Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERDs)** for schema visualization
- **GitHub** for version control and project documentation

---

## 🏗️ Database Schema
The database consists of six tables with proper **primary keys, foreign keys, and constraints**:

- **employees** – Employee details (name, birth date, sex, hire date, title ID)
- **titles** – Job titles
- **salaries** – Employee salaries
- **departments** – Company departments
- **dept_emp** – Relationship between employees and departments
- **dept_manager** – Department managers

📌 An **ERD** was created to visualize table relationships.

## 📊 Example Queries
Some example business questions answered using SQL:

- List employee details with salaries:

```sql
   SELECT employees.emp_no, employees.last_name, employees.first_name, employees.sex, salaries.salary
   FROM employees
   JOIN salaries
   ON employees.emp_no = salaries.emp_no;
```
- List employees hired in 1986:

```sql
   SELECT first_name, last_name
   FROM employees
   WHERE hire_date BETWEEN '12/31/1985' AND '1/1/1987'
```

- List the managers of each department:

```sql
   SELECT departments.dept_no, departments.dept_name, dept_manager.emp_no, employees.last_name, employees.first_name
   FROM departments
   JOIN dept_manager
   ON departments.dept_no = dept_manager.dept_no
   JOIN employees
   ON dept_manager.emp_no = employees.emp_no;
```

- Count employees by last name (frequency analysis):

```sql
   SELECT last_name,
   COUNT(last_name) AS "last_name_counts"
   FROM employees
   GROUP BY last_name
   ORDER BY
   COUNT(last_name) DESC;
   ```
